# **📊 Data Analysis Internship - Level 1 (Task 1)**  
### **Restaurant Data Analysis: Cuisines & Restaurant Distribution**  

## **📖 Introduction**  
This project is part of my **Level 1 Data Analysis Internship**, where I analyze a dataset containing information about restaurants. The focus of this task is to **identify the most common cuisines, calculate their distribution**, and **analyze restaurant ratings across different cities**.  

By applying **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn**, I cleaned the dataset, extracted insights, and visualized key trends to help understand **cuisine popularity**.  

---

## **📌 Task Overview**  
In this task, we analyze a restaurant dataset to:  
✔️ Identify the **top three most common cuisines**.  
✔️ Calculate the **percentage of restaurants** serving each top cuisine.  

This analysis provides **valuable insights** for businesses and customers by identifying food trends and high-rated restaurant locations.

## **🔍 Solution Walkthrough**  

### **1️⃣ Data Preparation**
- **Imported necessary libraries:**  
  - `Pandas` for data handling  
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations  
  - `Matplotlib & Seaborn` for visualization  
- **Loaded the dataset** from a CSV file.  
- **Performed data cleaning** by removing missing values in the `"Cuisines"` column.  

### **2️⃣ Cuisine Analysis**
- Extracted all unique cuisines from the dataset.  
- Counted the **number of restaurants** serving each cuisine.  
- Identified the **top three most common cuisines**.  
- Calculated the **percentage of restaurants** offering these cuisines using the formula:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{cuisine count}}{\text{total restaurants}} \right) \times 100
  \]
